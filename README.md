# Master Git Guide

## Introduction
Git is a powerful version control system that allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your project effectively. This guide will cover key concepts and commands in Git with detailed explanations and examples.

---

## 1. **Initial Setup**

Before you start using Git, you need to configure your Git environment.

### Set your user name and email:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
- `--global`: applies the configuration globally (for all repositories).
- `user.name`: your name.
- `user.email`: your email address used on GitHub or GitLab.

---

## 2. **Creating a New Repository**

### To create a new Git repository:
```bash
git init
```
This will initialize a new Git repository in the current directory.

---

## 3. **Cloning an Existing Repository**

### To clone a repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
This will create a local copy of the repository on your computer.

---

## 4. **Checking the Current Branch**

### To see which branch you are currently on:
```bash
git branch
```
The current branch will have an asterisk next to it.

---

## 5. **Creating and Switching Branches**

### To create a new branch:
```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

### To switch to a branch:
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

### To create and switch to a new branch in one command:
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

### To rename the current branch:
```bash
git branch -M <new-branch-name>
```

---

## 6. **Making Changes and Staging**

### Check the status of your working directory:
```bash
git status
```
- This will show you which files have been modified, added, or deleted.

### To add changes to the staging area:
```bash
git add <file-name>
```
- This stages the changes for commit.

### To add all changes in the directory:
```bash
git add .
```

---

## 7. **Committing Changes**

### To commit changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
- This records your changes in Git history with a commit message.

---

## 8. **Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository**

### To push changes to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```
- `origin`: refers to the remote repository.
- `<branch-name>`: the branch you want to push changes to.

---

## 9. **Pulling Changes from a Remote Repository**

### To fetch and merge changes from the remote repository:
```bash
git pull origin <branch-name>
```
- This brings the latest changes from the specified remote branch.

---

## 10. **Merging Branches**

### To merge one branch into the current branch:
```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```
- Merging combines the history of the two branches into one.

---

## 11. **Deleting Branches**

### To delete a branch locally:
```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

### To delete a branch remotely:
```bash
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

---

## 12. **Reverting Changes**

### To revert a commit (create a new commit to undo the changes):
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```
- This creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in a previous commit.

---

## 13. **Resetting Changes**

### To reset changes (remove commits):
```bash
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```
- This will reset your current branch to a previous commit and discard all changes after that commit.

---

## 14. **Viewing Commit History**

### To view the commit history:
```bash
git log
```
This shows a list of commits in the current branch with details like commit hash, author, and date.

---

## 15. **Creating and Managing Releases**

### To create a new release:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```
- This creates a tag named `v1.0.0` which is often used to mark specific points in history like releases.

### To push the release (tag) to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Conclusion

Git is a powerful tool that helps developers track and manage changes in code. By mastering the basic and advanced Git commands, you will be able to manage your projects and collaborate effectively with others.
